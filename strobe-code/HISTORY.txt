    Realized that cSHAKE S is a bit string, so its length is 12*8 and not 12.
    
    Informally tested against someone else's cSHAKE test vectors, so at this
    point it might actually be right.
    
    Spec bump to 1.0.2.
    
2017-01-06:
    Adjust, hopefully, to accommodate changes between NIST cSHAKE (SP 800-185)
    draft and release.

    Spec bump to 1.0.1.

2016-12-30:
    Spec bump to 1.0.0.  Public release.
    
    The framework *code* (as opposed to the spec it implements) currently
    doesn't have a version number and should be considered alpha-quality
    software.

2016-12-06:
    Release version 0.9.1.  This isn't a full public release yet, because I
    need to get legal approval for that.
