    <h2>Version and changelog</h2>
    <p>This is version 1.0.2 of the <span class="sc">Strobe</span> specification.
        The software is in alpha.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>January 24, 2017: version 1.0.2.  Fix the length of <var>S</var> in
            the cSHAKE domain separation string.  Hopefully the last change
            for this silly reason.</li>
        <li>January 6, 2017: version 1.0.1.  Adjust, hopefully, to the final version
            of the NIST cSHAKE standard.  The difference is how the empty
            personalization string is encoded, and in the order of the <var>N</var>
            and <var>S</var> strings.  The draft was ambiguous, but <var>N</var>
            followed <var>S</var> and the empty string was probably best interpreted
            as <code>[0]</code>.  The final version
            changed it to <code>[1,0]</code> with <var>N</var> preceding <var>S</var>.
            I'm still not sure I got it right because there are no test vectors.</li>
        <li>January 3, 2017: version 1.0.0.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) promises ubiquitous, cheap, connected devices.
        Unfortunately, most of these devices are hastily developed and will never
        receive code updates. Part of the IoT's security problem is cryptographic,
        but established cryptographic solutions seem too heavy or too inflexible
        to adapt to new use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="sc">Strobe</span> is a new framework for cryptographic
        protocols.  It can also be used for regular encryption.  Its goals are
        to make cryptographic protocols much simpler to develop, deploy and analyze;
        and to fit into even tiny IoT devices.  To that end, it uses only one block
        function &mdash; <span class="sc">Keccak</span>-<i>f</i> &mdash; to encrypt
        and authenticate messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flexibility is an important goal of <span class="sc">Strobe</span>.  It isn't
        just a replacement for TLS.  I specifically designed it to support
        a wide variety of protocol building blocks: authenticated DH or FHMQV,
        signatures, password-authenticated key exchange, DPA-resistant key diversification,
        ratcheting for forward secrecy, and steganographic connections with length hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Performance is a secondary goal.  <span class="sc">Strobe</span> is based
        on SHA-3, or rather <span class="sc">Keccak</span>-<i>f</i> and cSHAKE
        (draft NIST SP 800-185).  SHA-3 is a very conservative design.  It doesn't
        yet have acceleration on most CPUs, and it isn't the fastest algorithm around.
        That said, <span class="sc">Strobe</span> is generic and could be rebuilt
        around a faster permutation once one appears.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-goals</h2>
    <p>
        Any framework has some rails.  <span class="sc">Strobe</span>'s main rails
        are around message flow.  As a protocol framework, it isn't designed to handle
        unreliable or out-of-order message delivery.  It can still be used as an
        authenticated cipher, hash function, key derivation function etc. in these protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="sc">Strobe</span> isn't inherently nonce-misuse resistant.
        However, it can be used in an SIV construction to add this property.
